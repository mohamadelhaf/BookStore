                <p class="book-detail-desc">Madame Bovary begins when Charles Bovary is a young boy, unable to fit in at
                    his new school and ridiculed by his new classmates. As a child, and later when he grows into a young
                    man, Charles is mediocre and dull. He fails his first medical exam and only barely manages to become
                    a second-rate country doctor. His mother marries him off to a widow who dies soon afterward, leaving
                    Charles much less money than he expected.</p>
