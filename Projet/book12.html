                    Ring in the fictional world of Middle-earth. The long novel, commonly published as three volumes and
                    mistakenly called a trilogy, centers around the magical One Ring, which was discovered by Bilbo
                    Baggins in the earlier novel The Hobbit. Now, the free peoples of Middle-earth, such as Men, Elves,
                    Dwarves, and Hobbits, must overcome the dark power of Sauron by destroying the Ring.</p>
