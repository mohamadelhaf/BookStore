                    Our goal is to provide a page on the web for every book ever published. We are a catalog. The
                    project began in November 2007 and has been inhaling catalog records from some of the biggest
                    libraries in the world ever since. We have well over 20 million
                    edition records online, provide access to 1.7 million scanned versions of books. The secondary goal
                    is to get you as close to the actual document you're looking for as we can, whether that is a
                    scanned version courtesy of the Internet
                    Archive, or a link to Powell's where you can purchase your own copy. Our goal is to list every book
                    -- whether in-print or out-of-print, available at a bookstore or a library, scanned or typed in as
                    text. In other words, we provide
                    access to all books. </p>
